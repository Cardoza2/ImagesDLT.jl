# ImagesDLT.jl
A DLT particle tracker for sets of image pairs written for my experimental fluids class. See `testing/demonstration.jl` for a demostration on how to use the code. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to find a good way to find calibration points using Julia based-code, so I ended up using `ginput()` from MATLAB.
